          <p class="text-muted"> This school church is an important pillar for the school. This school church helped our
            students get closer to god and will for years to come. Many people ignore their religion and one of the
            reasons are studies. But not here. We believe our religion comes first. So, If a prayer is due we will
            ensure we pray no matter what. And this church is proof of that. </p>

      <p class="text-muted"> School library is an important addition for many schools. This school is no different. We
        strongly believe reading improves vocabulary, speaking skills, understanding of languages, knowledge, etc. Our
        school library consists of about 50,000+ books on a large variety of topics, genres, etc. </p>

        (since its indoors) made sure that despite of whatever harsh conditions which make it pretty painful outside,
        The
        morning assembly, annual day celebration, etc. are still possible. </p>
